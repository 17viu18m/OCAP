Source for tutorial on generating .emf file: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA:_Cheats#TOPOGRAPHY

This guide assumes you have the program OSGeo4W installed.
(https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)

1. 	Run Arma 3 as Administrator (right click on arma3.exe > Run as administrator).

2. 	Open desired map in 2D editor (does not work in 3D editor).
	Note: 2D editor can be accessed by pressing Shift + O on map selection screen.

3. 	Press Left Shift + Numpad Minus (-).
	Release both keys and then blindly type EXPORTNOGRID (or TOPOGRAPHY if map grid wanted).
	An "Activated EXPORTNOGRID" message should (very briefly) appear.

4.	Go to C:\ and check for <worldname>.emf. If no file is found, make sure you followed step 1.
 	Close Arma 3 (important).

5. 	Download BI Tools (https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/BI_Tools_2.5)
	and locate EmfToPng.exe  (in Visitor 3 folder).
	Copy EmfToPng.exe to a place you have write access (without need to run as administrator).

6. 	Copy <worldname>.emf (from step 4) to same folder as where we just copied EmfToPng.exe.
	Create a shortcut of EmfToPng.exe that launches with arguments: <worldname>.emf N
	
	N is the zoom level. We want to find the N which results in an image with dimensions that adheres to
	the tile size chart (see below). This may take some experimenting and will vary between maps.
	N is usually somewhere between 0.1 and 2. The recommended target is 16384.
	A good place to start is N=1. From there, calculate which zoom level is needed to adhere
	to tile size chart.
	e.g. If N=1 results in image size of 20480, and we want zoom level 6 (16384), then we'd do
	16384/20480 = 0.8 = N

	Note: The resulting image dimensions (both X and Y) must adhere *exactly* to the tile size chart.

7. 	Run shortcut and wait until .emf is converted to a .png

8. 	Drag and drop <worldname>.png into OSGeo4W64 directory.
	Launch OSGeo4W64.bat and enter the followig command:
	gdal2tiles_legacy_no-tms -p raster -z 0-6 -w all <worldname>.png
	(assuming your image size is 16384 - zoom level 6)

	Note: gdal2tiles_legacy_no-tms is a modified version of gdal2tiles.
	To install, just drag the included gdal2tiles_legacy_no-tms .py and .bat
	files into OSGeo4W64\bin\.
